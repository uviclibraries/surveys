# Optional Activity: Advanced Branching

Advanced Branching allows you to customize survey paths based on pre-defined criteria. Depending on how respondents answer questions, they will take different routes through your survey. You can show or hide questions, navigate to different questions in the survey, or end the survey. This will help to ensure that only relevant data is gathered.

Common applications include:
-	Terminating a form to screen participants who are not eligible
-	Showing a follow-up question based on a response to a previous question
-	Displaying a message or warning
