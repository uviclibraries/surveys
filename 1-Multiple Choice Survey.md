6.	Now you have created the workspace for your survey. Please take a moment to visualize and explore your SurveyMonkey workspace. 

    - On the top ribbon you will see the stages of your survey from “SUMMARY TO PRESENT RESULTS”. 
    - In the left pane you will see that there are icons with option for your survey building process such as “BUILD”, “STYLE”, etc. 
    - In the middle of your workspace, there are also two “QUESTION BANKS” with pre-designed survey questions. On the main area you will see the title of your survey and a green button to design a NEW QUESTION.
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-05.png" style="margin-left:10px;width:600px;" alt="new question">
7.	Now that you are more familiar with the SurveyMonkey workspace, let’s start building up our survey about environmental attitudes.
 Click on the green button on the right lower corner that reads “NEW QUESTION” and type in Q1 (question 1) “How concerned are you about air pollution?” and enter some answers as the following and finish this question by saving it: <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-06.png" style="margin-left:10px; float:right; width:300px;" alt="new question">
    - _Tip! Make sure that multiple-choice option is enabled in the box on the right side of the question, as you can see there are many types of questions we can have, but today we are focusing on Multiple-choice._
    - As you type in you will see this on your screen, don’t forget to save it by clicking on the **Save** button at the end of the page.<img src="images/act-1/sm-1-07.png" style="margin-left:10px; width:400px;" alt="screenshot">
    - Once you save your first survey question, it will look like this:
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-08.png" style="margin-left:10px; width:500px;" alt="first question">
    - Note that there are some boxes for you to edit your question and answers, apply logic to it, copy the question or delete it. Feel free to either explore it or to move to the next step.

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-09.png" style="margin-left:10px; float:right; width:200px;" alt="create survey">

9. Proceed and click the **TRIANGLE** next to the button **+NEXT QUESTION**

11. Now that our questions are complete we can format our survey. It is a great time to use our creativity and think strategically about having a survey that engages the audience beyond the survey questions. We can add color to the survey, add a logo, a footer, the layout, fronts, and we can also choose different themes for the survey.  Click on the icon “STYLE” on the left column and modify the style of your survey by adding colors, changing the font, adding a image as a logo from your choosing and so on.
    
12.	Choosing the FORMAT of your survey. This means that you can set how the questions will show up to the audience: 1) as a classic survey all in a page, 2) One question at time; 3) As a conversation (similar to a digital chat). Let’s try one question at time, this is a great way to get people worry-free about the length of the survey.
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-15.png" style="margin-left:10px; width:200px;" alt="create survey">
    - Next to the option “ONE QUESTION AT A TIME” you can click on the arrow > and customize the button to pass from one question to another. You can, for instance, choose “OK”, “NEXT QUESTION”, “NEXT”, etc. 

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-16.png" style="margin-left:10px; width:200px;" alt="create survey">
    
     <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-17.png" style="margin-left:10px; float:right; width:300px;" alt="create survey">
13.	Now let’s go to the top ribbon and explore the option ‘PREVIEW & SCORE”. In this section we can have a view of how our survey will look like on different types of screens using **DEVICE VIEW**. <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-18.png" style="width:150px;" alt="create survey"> 
    - SurveyMonkey automatically shows you the estimated completion rate of the process of your survey so far, the estimated time for someone to complete it, and any recommendations that the system may have. 

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-19.png" style="float:right; width:200px;" alt="create survey"> 
    
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-20.png" style="float:right; width:150px;" alt="create survey"> 

    - **_TIP: THIS IS ALSO A GREAT MOMENT TO DOUBLE CHECK THE SURVEY TO MAKE SURE IT IS AS GOOD AS YOU WOULD LIKE._**

14.	On the top of the page click “NEXT” and you can see some options to collect your response, today, we are choosing to “SEND SURVEYS YOUR WAY”.

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-21.png" style="width:400px;" alt="create survey"> 

    

15.	The following image will pop up, and you have many options to spread your survey out. Take a moment on the option, and once you. Have read them out, choose “SHARE A SURVEY LINK”.
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-23.png" style="float:right; width:200px;" alt="create survey"> 
    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-22.png" style="width:400px;" alt="create survey"> 

16.	A page with a link should have pop “WE LINK 1”, you can copy your survey link and spread it out! Alternatively, you can also customize the link to make it reflect your survey/project.

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-24.png" style=" width:400px;" alt="create survey"> 
    
    - To customize the link, simply click on the button “CUSTOMIZE” on the right side of your web link and change the name after the /. Then click on “SAVE”. I for example, chose to call my survey ENVIRONMENTSURVEY.

    <img src="images/act-1/sm-1-25.png" style="width:400px;" alt="create survey"> 

17.	Now we are all set up to collect answers, copy the link and share with five people in this workshop, and make sure to also respond the survey link that your colleagues will send to you. Please be aware that anyone with your survey link will be able to answer it. 

    - This step will take 2-3 minutes. Below you can see my link, but you need to copy your own weblink. Feel free to respond it as well.
