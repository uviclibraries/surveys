## Matrix Questions
Purpose: To evaluate 1 or more items using the same column options for each row. It is suggested to limit the amount of questions to a maximum of 5 rows or less. This will help insure more validity in responses.

 If not all respondents can repond select **NA**. Also if your row questions are lengthy, select **options**, **adjust question layout** and then change **label width**. Under the options tab you may also make the question mandatory by selecting **require an answer to this question**

## Single Row Rating
1. Following the same steps of a matrix question, you do not have step 3 of adding rows as there will only be the main question and a rating scale. To do this select **"Make this a single-row rating scale (remove row choices)."**. (see screenshot below)<br>
