 If not all respondents can respond select **NA**. Also if your row questions are lengthy, select **options**, **adjust question layout** and then change **label width**. Under the options tab you may also make the question mandatory by selecting **require an answer to this question**

## Single Row Rating
1. Follow the same steps of a matrix question; but then you do not need to add rows, as there will only be the main question and a rating scale. To do this, select **"Make this a single-row rating scale (remove row choices)."**. (see screenshot below)<br>
